# Community
### How we support you and leverage partners
We see our architectures as products but also as templates for others to follow, which is why we embrace transparency and open-source principles. By sharing legacy insights, we enable the broader community to build upon our work, driving collective progress in the metal additive manufacturing industry.

We work in thesis to introduce technologies that displace weight and advance the industry as a whole. This commitment to innovation and community engagement is why we have established our presence on GitHub. We are here to maximize transparency and to embody our belief in open-source documentation; this is also where our mainline [manual](https://github.com/Rosotics/Manual) is published.

On this repository, you will find our legacy work in the field, dating back to late 2017. We invite you to utilize this work under CERN-OHL-S-2.0, to take our ideas and adapt them to create something useful in other contexts, or to simply learn more about our hardware and software. This open-access approach allows you to more quickly understand and derive solutions in order to better architect approaches. 

#### *It is worth noting however, that this repository is limited in scope to only legacy approaches, and is not representative of currently utilized hardware, software, or process methodologies found on our current platforms or our manual.*

We actively support community engagement through open-source initiatives, to help make these technologies more accessible to a broader audience. By sharing our research and best practices, we work to promote transparency and encourage collaborative development. This approach empowers both individuals and organizations to push the boundaries of what is possible in our industry, which we will too benefit from seeing. Our partnerships extend to academic institutions as well; we support research initiatives and provide opportunities for students to engage in real-world research + development.

We are committed to promoting industry standards and best practices in metal additive manufacturing. By participating in industry consortiums and working groups, we help shape guidelines and protocols that ensure safety, quality, and efficiency across the sector. Our involvement in these initiatives ensures that our technologies align with the highest standards and contribute to the overall advancement of the industry.

Supporting our local community and promoting STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is another core aspect of our mission. Through outreach programs, school partnerships, and public outreach, we aim to inspire and educate the next generation of innovators. By supporting local education initiatives and providing a platform for hands-on learning, we work to help cultivate a skilled workforce that will drive even more ambitious future advancements in manufacturing.

In conclusion, Rosotics' commitment to supporting the community and leveraging strategic partnerships is central to our overarching mission. By embracing open-source principles, fostering collaboration, and engaging with a diverse network of partners, we work to create a vibrant ecosystem that benefits not only our organization but the industry as a whole.

### Join Us
##### Internship â€” We run programs in the Summer and in the Fall. Please reach out to team members individually if interested.
##### Most roles at Rosotics are engineering-oriented as we are a startup company working to answer fundamentally challenging questions in materials science. Our interns have graduated to either full-time roles or have entered positions at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com), [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com), [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html), [RTX](https://www.rtx.com), and [Boeing](https://www.boeing.com). We are location and education agnostic, with most interns relocating from out of state from institutions such as [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu), [MIT](https://www.mit.edu), and [Embry-Riddle](https://erau.edu). Do not feel you need experience to apply, we encourage you to apply regardless. We are often the first internship on resume, and we are proud to be that first 'yes'. For full-time opportunities, visit here to view currently [open positions](https://rosotics.rippling-ats.com).
##### (While we look for many engineers, we do recognize talent where we see it. Please reach out if you believe another role could be useful to our mission)
