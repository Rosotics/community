## Abstract

A methodology is provided alongside a unified system to reduce to practice the additive manufacturing in part or in whole of a three-dimensional metallic structure. The methodology utilizes a plasma arc welding nozzle of the non-transferable arc type to create a fluid metallic pool, in tandem with an injector nozzle configured to subject a metallic wire feedstock to liquefaction by means of induction heating before ejection into said fluid metallic pool, while shielding gas is purged over the region and visual data is extracted using a camera in real-time. The unified system integrates each of these processes into a hardware element, performing the methodology from this hardware element containing a plasma arc welding nozzle and a slit and stipple vented injector nozzle, the injector nozzle containing an axial feedstock channel through which feedstock is delivered through the structure and an electric coil housed within and against the axial feedstock channel with its anode and cathode extending out of the injector nozzle’s wall for power delivery. Both nozzles are housed within a housing structure, which positions fans against the stipple and slit vents of the injector nozzle to extract gas produced during the process, while additionally housing a thermal camera mounted angular to the injector nozzle. The housing structure as a whole can interface with a motion system in order to position the housing structure and its components throughout space. A controller manages power delivery and resource delivery to both nozzles, in order to first create a fluid metallic pool below the housing structure by means of operating the plasma arc welding nozzle and subjecting a surface below the nozzle to liquefaction, before transferring and subjecting feedstock to liquefication by means of induction heating within the injector nozzle and subsequently ejecting this fluid from the injector nozzle into the liquified pool before said pool refuses. Digital elements analyze the collected visual data in real-time.

## Field

The present invention relates to metallic additive manufacturing technologies and methodologies, especially those utilized for producing relatively large-scale objects. The invention is useful for instances where energy efficiency is paramount or manufacturing system scale invariance is beneficial.

## Background

Metallic additive manufacturing methodologies and systems are well-researched and tested for the small-scale niche as well as the large-scale niche. Many of these systems involve the use of high-power lasers or electron beams to provide heat, which fuse metal payload into fully dense objects, and rarely include elements that are considered safe for humans to be nearby without substantial protective layers. Present metallic additive manufacturing methods are traditionally contained within a heavily controlled build container or environment, and are therefore only performable within the machine or a factory environment. Additionally, little to no existing methods are capable of being conducted from an isolated mobile platform due to the requirement for exorbitantly large amounts of power, created from inherent inefficiency at the process level.

A number of embodiments of energy-efficient metallic additive manufacturing systems are known and are recognized. Typically, these can include the use of directly subjecting the build substrate, existing structure of the print, and the feedstock itself to high amounts of electric current within a controlled build container. Methods of this nature are able to significantly lower process energy density when compared with alternative methods, however do not address and in some cases inflate the fundamental and inherently limiting issues of these alternatives, the paramount being a requirement for considerable environmental and electromechanical control.

Prior proposed metallic additive manufacturing methodologies and systems present various operational shortcomings and safety hazards. A majority of these systems involve the use of a high-power lasers or electron beams. This is a limitation in the nature that practicing the method becomes incredibly dangerous to human beings in a number of aspects, incredibly risky to deploy at scale, and impossible to mobilize outside of a factory environment in compliance with legal statutes. In addition, many of these methodologies and systems are distributed between several expensive and complex pieces of hardware, which presents additional challenges in maintenance.

### Detailed Summary of the Invention

It is an object of the invention to provide an improved system of metallic additive manufacturing which practices an improved process methodology, one that is capable of conducting all print operations from a unified hardware element. Furthermore, it is desired that the system and methodology will outperform prior art additive manufacturing methods in aspects of performance, safety, and energy efficiency.

It is also an object of the design of the invention to remove from the state flow dangerous sources of heat generation or material. This is in contrast with designs of prior art metallic additive manufacturing systems which can utilize high-power lasers or powdered metals.

The intended usage of the invention depends upon the external supply of electricity, liquid coolant, wire feedstock, orifice gas, and shielding gas to the invention. These resources can be stored by any means so chosen, as long as they are delivered with stability to the invention.

Our invention includes a process methodology and a system to perform this methodology entirely from a single unified hardware package.

The system, as viewed in FIG. 8, includes a housing structure which houses a number of components and is as a whole positionable from a greater motion system.

The process methodology is partly conducted from a structure referred to as the plasma arc welding nozzle (13), which is mounted within the leading end of the housing structure. The plasma arc welding nozzle, as seen in FIG. 4, contains an internal electrode which is connected to a cathode for DC negative, an internal liquid-cooled constricting nozzle which is connected to an anode for DC positive and surrounds the internal electrode, an outer nozzle which surrounds the internal constricting nozzle and under which a shielding gas envelope is formed between the internal constricting nozzle and the outer nozzle. An orifice gas envelope is formed between the internal electrode and internal constricting nozzle. Both shielding gas and orifice gas are delivered vertically from top to bottom before exiting the nozzle. Shielding gas is delivered through this nozzle in order to provide shielding to the region below from the effects of oxidation and hydrogen embrittlement. The plasma arc welding nozzle is used to create and expel a plasma jet at high velocity and temperature as well as a stream of shielding gas. A supply hose (8) is affixed to the plasma arc welding nozzle to deliver orifice gas used to generate the plasma, shielding gas which is transferred through the shielding gas envelope, coolant which is transferred through the internal liquid-cooled constricting nozzle, and electricity which is transferred through the DC circuit as desired. The process methodology is partly conducted from a structure referred to as the injector nozzle (10), seen in FIG. 6, which is mounted within the center of the housing structure. The injector nozzle, as seen in FIG. 1, contains venting from interior channels to the outside environment by means of a slit (1) and a pattern of stipple (2) extending around the nozzle’s wall. A feature referred to as the basal section (3) extends outward from the nozzle’s wall, and is used to secure the injector nozzle against the base of the housing structure when inserted. As viewed in the top profile of FIG. 2 and the angular profile of FIG. 3, the interior of the injector nozzle contains axially a channel for feedstock transfer (7), which extends through the length of the nozzle. Through this central channel, metallic wire-shaped feedstock is transferred vertically from top to bottom by the use of precise wire feed systems. An electric coil (6) is positioned within the injector nozzle, around the central feedstock channel, and separated from the central feedstock channel by means of a liner against the interior of the coil. The electric coil is terminated by an anode for DC positive (4) and a cathode for DC negative (5) which extend outwards from the nozzle, through two holes of the nozzle wall. Surrounding the coil is a second liner. The slit and stipple venting features of the nozzle wall are duplicated in each liner, to allow venting from the interior central feedstock channel. The electric coil is wound in such a sense as to provide a small amount of open space between each winding for a gas to escape through the coil element. The injector nozzle is used to liquefy a metallic feedstock by means of electromagnetic induction and inject this liquid into a fluid metallic pool directly below. The injector nozzle is mounted within the housing structure, as seen in FIG. 5. The housing structure additionally mounts several fans (11), as seen in FIG. 7, near the slit and stipple venting of the injector nozzle to extract gas produced inside the injector nozzle during operation. The housing structure additionally structurally balances the injector nozzle. Power is delivered to the injector nozzle using its anode and cathode after integration within the housing structure. Additionally, as seen in FIG. 8, a thermal camera (12) is mounted within the housing structure at an angle against the centerline of the injector nozzle. This camera is affixed with a zinc selenide window (9), as seen in FIG. 5, and is used to analyze the real-time process analytics as metallic payload is being deposited from the injector nozzle. Structural elements of the housing structure allow it to be affixed to a motion system, which can position the housing structure as a whole to a desired point in space. This motion system can be a traditional cartesian motion system on the x and y axes, or a 6-DOF robotic arm motion system moving through three-dimensional space, or another type of motion system. A metallic wire feedstock is housed within a separate storage structure, while shielding gas and orifice gas are stored within additional separate storage structures, liquid coolant is stored in an additional separate storage structure, and power is stored in a separate power source. An electronic controller manages power delivery from the power source to the integrated housing structure, including the injector nozzle, the plasma arc welding nozzle, and other components. The electronic controller also manages resource delivery from each storage structure to the injector nozzle and plasma arc welding nozzle, which is delivered to each nozzle by means of respective hoses and supply hardware, as seen in FIG. 9. The electronic controller also manages positioning of the housing structure as a whole throughout space. The thermal camera extracts in real-time a visual data stream which is provided to a separate computational device.

The invention’s process methodology is based on the principle of metallic fluid combination and consequently is conducted in two stages – a liquefaction stage and an injection stage. The liquefaction stage is facilitated by the plasma arc welding nozzle, configured for keyhole operation (over 100A of supplied DC current). As the process begins, motion systems position the housing structure and tip of the plasma arc welding nozzle to a desired deposition location located over a metallic surface. Two streams of gas are expelled from the plasma arc welding nozzle (through the orifice gas envelope and the shielding gas envelope) at certain gas flow rates. An electric arc is produced between the electrode and the internal constricting nozzle, within the internal constricting nozzle. The internal gaseous stream of orifice gas surrounding the electrode is ionized and forcefully constricted to the opening of the nozzle. This superheated plasma is expelled from the nozzle while the surrounding gaseous stream of shielding gas works to shield the plasma flow and respective contact region from oxidation. This process of ionization is performed using a certain amperage of electric current, sufficient to provide enough energy to the plasma to liquefy a metallic surface directly inferior to the nozzle, the plume penetrating into all or a portion of said surface. The region penetrated into the inferior surface is liquefied, forming a fluid pool in this region constrained by a molten wall. This region is referred to as the 'high temperature zone'.

As the plasma plume is expelled from the plasma arc welding nozzle, the greater housing structure is directed in motion sufficient that the plasma arc welding nozzle is leading in the direction of travel and the injector nozzle is oriented to follow the plasma arc welding nozzle in the direction of travel. The fluid pool created consequently travels elliptically with motion of the housing structure. As the housing structure travels, portions of the fluid pool will cool in regions no longer in contact with plasma, causing these regions to refuse into solidified metal. Simultaneous to the process of liquefaction, conductive wire feedstock is transferred into and through the injector nozzle by precise wire-feed systems, either separate from the housing structure or integrated within it. During this process, electric current is fed through the coiled nozzle and into the metal feedstock by means of electromagnetic induction, subjecting the metal feedstock to a phenomenon known as induction heating, through heat generated in the feedstock by eddy currents. The current delivered through electromagnetic induction melts the leading region of the wire feedstock into the liquid state, which is subsequently ejected from the injector nozzle into the fluid pool directly inferior as the housing structure is led in motion. The ejected fluid will join the previously liquefied material of the surface below, to form a blended fluid pool. The direction of solidification of this blended fluid pool consequently follows the direction of travel of the fluid pool, its region of solidification referred to as the 'solidification front'. The solidification front gradually refuses this blended fluid pool, solidifying the surface with the newly injected material, concluding in an elliptical weld beam pattern. Plasma-derived liquefaction, feedstock liquefaction and injection, and solidification continues while the housing structure travels, injecting material at rapid linear speed, fusing together to gradually form fully dense metal structures. Gas and heat generated within the injector nozzle during feedstock liquefaction escapes the injector nozzle through venting of the nozzle, extracted by the housing structure. The thermal camera affixed within the housing structure captures visual data as these functions are conducted. Digital elements are utilized to analyze the real-time process state analytics of the process using this visual data as it is conducted either within the electronic controller or within a separate computational device.
